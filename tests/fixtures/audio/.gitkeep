# Audio test fixtures
#
# Place test audio files here:
# - hello-world.wav: Short "Hello World" recording
# - long-speech.wav: 30+ second recording
# - multilingual.wav: Non-English speech samples
#
# For CI, these can be generated using text-to-speech or
# downloaded from a test assets repository.
